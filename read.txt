-----> In fast api when we when we define a response model class for an endpoint using response_model class . it is used for two purposes

1. Validation
---> the response data returned from the endpoint is validated against the specified pydantic model.so that data adhre to the specified structure and type

2. for documentation purpose it is also required


Authentication------------>

2. session authentication:- a session is established on the serevr after a successful login. the session information is stored in session identifier which sent to the client by server.
the client includes this session identifier in subsequent request to authenticate itself. sessions are stateful means server stores information about authenticated user on its side.
the session identifier is used to look up for the user on the server which is sent by the client.session identifier is usually stored in cookie on client side but the actual session data is stored on server.



JWT Token ------------------>

first is header ----> header consists of two parts first is type of token and second is signing algorithm being used.
second is payload -------> it countains the data about the user e.g user identity , user role
third is signature--------> the signature is used to verify that sender of jwt is who says it and sender of message is
